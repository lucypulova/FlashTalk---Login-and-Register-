# FlashTalk ‚Äì Instant Messenger

**FlashTalk** is a full-stack Instant Messenger application developed as a student project. It allows users to register, log in, and access a protected chat interface. The application is built with **React + Redux Toolkit (frontend)** and **Express + TypeScript (backend)**. Authentication is handled using **JWT** and **bcrypt**, and user data is stored in a local JSON file.

## ‚ú® Features

- User registration and login
- JWT-based authentication
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Protected routes and persistent login state
- Modular Express backend and React frontend
- Clean architecture and easy scalability

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React
- TypeScript
- Redux Toolkit
- redux-persist
- Vite

**Backend:**
- Node.js
- Express
- TypeScript
- bcrypt
- jsonwebtoken

  
## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lucypulova/FlashTalk-Login-and-Register
cd flashtalk
```

---

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file inside the `backend/` directory with the following content:

```
JWT_SECRET=super-secret-key
SERVER_PORT=8080
SERVER_HOSTNAME=localhost
```

Ensure that `src/data/users.json` exists with either:

```json
[]
```

or predefined users for testing.

Start the backend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the **root** of the frontend directory (next to `package.json`):

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/
```

Start the frontend development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

### ‚úÖ Done!

You can now:
- Register a new user
- Log in
- Access the protected chat page

## üß™ Test Users

Preloaded users exist in `users.json`. You can use them to test login functionality.

Example:

```makefile
email: lyudmila@example.com
password: pass1234
```

## üîí Protected Frontend Pages

Some pages in FlashTalk are accessible only to authenticated users. These protected routes ensure that sensitive content, like the chat interface, is not available to users without a valid session.

- For example, the route `/chat` requires the user to be logged in with a valid **JWT token**.
- Authentication state is managed via **Redux Toolkit**.
- Persistent login is achieved using **redux-persist**, so the user remains logged in even after refreshing the page.
- Navigation is controlled using **React Router DOM**, with a custom `ProtectedRoute` wrapper that checks if the user has access before rendering a page.

If the token is missing or invalid, users are automatically redirected to the login page.

## üß± Key Components

Below is a list of essential components that make up the authentication and routing logic:

- **`authRoutes.ts`**  
  Handles public API routes for user registration and login. It validates input, hashes passwords using bcrypt, and issues JWT tokens upon successful login.

- **`authMiddleware.ts`**  
  A middleware function that checks for a valid JWT token in the request headers. If valid, it adds the user information to the request object; otherwise, it blocks access to protected routes.

- **`protectedRoutes.ts`**  
  Contains backend API endpoints that require authentication. These routes are only accessible to users who have a verified token (e.g., `/me`, `/settings`, `/logout`).

- **`RegisterForm.tsx` / `LoginForm.tsx`**  
  React components that provide UI and logic for user registration and login. They include client-side validation and communicate with the backend via Axios.

- **`Chat.tsx`**  
  The main protected page available only to authenticated users. It displays personalized content (e.g., welcome message) and provides a logout option.

- **`ProtectedRoute.tsx`**  
  A custom wrapper for React routes that checks if a valid token is present in the Redux store. If the user is not authenticated, it redirects them to `/login`.

These components together form the foundation of FlashTalk's secure user authentication flow, and they ensure that only authorized users can access private features of the application.
